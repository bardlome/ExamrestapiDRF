Used version of python: Python 3.5.2
Also, an interface is an example one, from django rest.

worked under virtualenv, on Ubuntu 16.04 (example):
bardlome@bardlome-Lenovo-Z580:~/nowy2$ virtualenv --python=python3 envforchallange
bardlome@bardlome-Lenovo-Z580:~/nowy2$ source envforchallange/bin/activate 

tests.py are included in exams_api/exams, executed with command from terminal (example):
(envforchallange) bardlome@bardlome-Lenovo-Z580:~/nowy2/envforchallange/exams_api$ python  manage.py  test  exams

to create superuser, execute command from terminal (example):
(envforchallange) bardlome@bardlome-Lenovo-Z580:~/nowy2/envforchallange/exams_api$ python  manage.py  createsuperuser

to start, execute command from terminal (example):
(envforchallange) bardlome@bardlome-Lenovo-Z580:~/nowy2/envforchallange/exams_api$ python  manage.py  runserver


feel free to run tests from "exams" directory, and quickly check out how does it work at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/
feel free to delete the example sqlite database and start your own one!
remember, that some of the functions REQUIRE an non-anonymous user(log in!)
and some views (for example exam details) require an owner to be logged in to see it!
